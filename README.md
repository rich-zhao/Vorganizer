# Vorganizer
Video Organizer built in C# and WPF. Use custom categories and tags to organize your videos! 
This application is a windows only application that lets you create a sqlite database with a listing of the location of 
your videos that you specify. You can drag-and-drop folders of videos to load them into the database and 
create categories and tags to help you filter through them.

## Preface
I built this application mainly for myself, which was because I have a ton of video/movies that I wanted to organize and filter.
It's not the most amazing program, but there actually weren't many good alternatives that I could find that met my needs (Heck, thats what we're here for eh). 

## Releases
### Release 1.0

Everything 'technically should work'; It's just that I got bored of the verbosity of C# and WPF.
